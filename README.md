<h1 align="center"> Magnetic Tachometer </h1>

## Project Goal
The project focuses on the development of a magnetic tachometer from the linear Hall-effect sensor 811JF-55A4.

To achieve this aim, the sensor was used in combination with the following hardware:
- Arduino Micro;
- LM358AN OpAmp;
- 10K Potentiometer;
- HC-05 Bluetooth module;
- Neodymium Magnet (N35);

## Files
Folders are organized as follows:

- __Arduino Code__ hosts the `.ino` file containing the algorithm for RPM measurements;
- __Calibration__ hosts the MATLAB code used to display the measures performed to characterize the sensor;
- __Circuit__ hosts the circuit diagrams made using Fritzing software;

## Next Steps
The next stages in the development of the device will be focused on:
1. Creating a GUI via Processing to allow the user to get RPM readings on an Android smartphone via Blueooth
2. Designing and printing a case so to perform live measurements on a bicycle
